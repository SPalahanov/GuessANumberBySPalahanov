# "The Guess A Number" Game by SPalahanov

A console-based C# implementation of the "Rock - Paper - Scissors" game.

Guess The Number is a game where you must use your logic in order to guess a secret number selected by the computer at the beginning of the game. 
The game has two levels of difficulty, the range of the searched number and the number of attempts to guess it depends on these levels. 
Using information from the computer's reply, you must guess the number. Good luck!

# Input:
 - On first level - input is number from [1 to 100]
 - On second level - input is number from [1 to 200]
# Output;
 - The computer picks a random number and indicates whether the number entered by the player is Too Low, Too High, Invalid or Guessed.

#Method While making this program we will follow a workflow which will be like:

 - Accepting user input.
 - Generating random output.
 - Comparing the choices.
 - Declare whether the number is guessed. Since it is a guess game, it requires input from the user in order to generate some result.
 - The working of this program will have several functions and methods. Once it gets the input from the user it will compare the input with the input generated by the system. This system generated input will be random. Once it gets player inputs, it will do the conditional rendering.
